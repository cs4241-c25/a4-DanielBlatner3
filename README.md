This is a novel collection-building tool for Magic: The Gathering.
It allows users to swipe left or right to discard or add a card to your collection.
The user can rename their collection and share it with the URL.


How to use:

Log in with a Github account.
Swipe left to discard a randomly chosen card, swipe right to add the card to your collection.
Go to the collection tab to view cards you've added, you can delete them there.

You can change the name of your collection by clicking on the title, and saving a new name in the input field.

The title is a play on the Magic: The Gathering card, titled Tinder Wall, connecting the term Tinder with the popular dating app that introduced the swiping interface.
